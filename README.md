# ARC-NASA-CSGC-infrasound

Research under Professor [Paulo Afonso](https://losrios.edu/about-los-rios/contact-us/employee-directory/employee?xid=x76049&id=1085001) at [AMERICAN RIVER COLLEGE (ARC)](https://arc.losrios.edu/) funded by [NASA California Space Grant Consortium (CSGC)](https://casgc.ucsd.edu/) to study infrasound collection and analysis.

Datasets used, sourced from the Boise State University Infrasound Data Repository:

- [Data for Forecasting the Eruption of an Open-vent Volcano Using Resonant Infrasound Tones (Boise State ScholarWorks)](https://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/infrasound_data/1/)
    - Jeffery Johnson, Leighton M. Watson, Jose L. Palma, Eric M. Dunham, Jacob F. Anderson
    - DOI: https://doi.org/10.18122/B21B0C

- [Dataset for Whitewater Sound Dependence on Discharge and Wave Configuration at an Adjustable Wave Feature](https://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/infrasound_data/11/)
    - Taylor Tatum, Jacob Anderson
    - DOI: https://doi.org/10.18122/infrasound_data.11.boisestate

Please create a new directory /datasets in the root of the project and download the datasets from the links above. The datasets are too large to be included in the repository and as such are included in the .gitignore file and are ignored by git.
